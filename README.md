# AirBnB Clone Project

## Part 1 - command interpreter

### This project will entail:

- Putting in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of future instances
- Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- Creating all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Placeâ€¦`) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
